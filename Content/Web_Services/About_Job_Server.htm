        <h1><a name="kanchor19"></a>About the Job Server</h1>
        <p class="subheading">SUMMARY</p>
        <p>The Job Server enables you to schedule single and recurring tasks for 
 immediate or delayed execution, either manually or dynamically at run 
 time. It executes tasks out of process, freeing up worker threads and 
 memory for client sessions. Good candidates for this are long running 
 tasks and resource intensive tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="p-Bullets" value="1">
                <p class="Bullets">Long running tasks – Offload 
	 long running tasks to the Job Server so they run asynchronously. When 
	 user sessions do not have to wait for long running processes to complete, 
	 you will see fewer request time outs.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullets" value="2">
                <p class="Bullets">Intensive tasks - Eliminate 
	 competition for computing resources by off-loading processing/memory 
	 intensive tasks to the Job Server. The Job Server uses a different 
	 application pool (and thus separate memory and worker threads) than 
	 the Web Host. It can even be located on a separate server.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Job Server is a shared service that can be consumed by any <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> adaptive client, including 
 Web, Windows, and Mobile.</p>
        <p class="subheading">FRAMEWORK</p>
        <p>You create a job using the .NET language and make use of the standard 
 <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> ORM framework 
 and services that are available when creating various Web Client customizations. 
 Write user interfaces for or interact directly with the Job Server and 
 its related components through SData service endpoints or WCF endpoints.</p>
        <p>The core component that handles the scheduling and thread pool management 
 is the open source Quartz.NET library, a port of the Quartz Java project 
 which has been actively developed for over 7 years.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Record access security</p>
        <p>You can code a job to use the security credentials of the system administrator 
 or of a user specified at run time. Night batch jobs such as UpdateRemainingDays 
 (of Contract) are commonly run with system administrator credentials. 
 Tasks initiated by end-users such as UpdateEntityJob and DeleteEntityJob 
 typically run using the credentials of the initiating user.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Install Location</p>
        <p>The SData portal and the "Job Server" service may reside on 
 separate machines. The "Job Server" service is commonly installed 
 on the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> application 
 server where the “<span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 Server” service is installed.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Additional Documentation</p>
        <p>See <span style="font-style: italic;">An Introduction to Job Server 
 in <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span></span> 
 for technical details including endpoints, extended explanations, and 
 usage examples.</p>
