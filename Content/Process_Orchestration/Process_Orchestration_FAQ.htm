 Orchestration FAQ and Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p>Collected below are some frequently asked questions to consider when 
 working with <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span><a name="kanchor79"></a> 
 Process Orchestration:</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: 
 How do I configure additional debug-logging for the Process Host?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 uses log4net by Apache: Exceptions, errors, and start up events are logged 
 to the Application Event Log as <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 Process Host. &#160;Make changes to logging by altering the log4net.config 
 file in the root directory of the process host web site. &#160;A restart 
 will be required. &#160;View documentation on additional debugging configuration 
 specific to the process host in the log4net.config file deployed to the 
 site.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For additional information on log4net, see 
 <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html" style="font-weight: normal;">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/</a></p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: Can workflows have duplicate 
 names if they reside in different workflow assembly libraries?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: Not at this time.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: How do I make my workflow 
 projects aware of model changes? What location should I use when I add 
 a reference in my VS project to Sage.Entity.Interfaces.dll?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: The <a href="Installing_SalesLogix_VS_Workflow_Items.htm">Installing 
 SalesLogix VS Workflow Items</a> Help topic instructs you to consolidate 
 assemblies in a single folder.&#160;All workflow projects should use this 
 new folder as the source of referenced assemblies.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Sage.Entity.Interfaces.dll should also 
 be referenced from this folder, as it will automatically be updated whenever 
 you build interfaces or build the web platform in Application Architect.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: When should the MS workflow 
 run time be started?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: Anytime you start your <span class="PrimaryPortalProcessHost">Process Host portal</span> (through 
 IIS or web dev server for example), you must restart the MS workflow run 
 time by browsing to http://servername:port/ProcessHost/Processmanager/crm/-/Processes.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: When do changes made to 
 the ProcessStart.xml file take effect?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: Changes to the ProcessStart.xml file take 
 effect as soon as the file is saved in the portal. &#160;Saved changes 
 are detected immediately by the MS workflow run time.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: When do changes to the ProcessLib.xml 
 file take effect?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: Changes to the processlib.xml take effect 
 as soon as the &#160;file is saved. &#160;You can verify your changes 
 are in effect by browsing to http://servername:port/ProcessHost/Processmanager/crm/-/Processes.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: Can the MS workflow run 
 time listen for nonspecific changes to an entity?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: No, it only listens for changes to properties 
 you specify. So in the processstart.xml file, the memberfilter parameter 
 on runprocess is required and must have at least one entity property for 
 which changes are being watched.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: If a process name listed 
 in the processstart.xml cannot be found, what happens?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: When an action tries to start a process 
 it cannot find, an exception is logged.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><span class="SLXBold">Q: How should I change a workflow 
 that is already deployed to production?</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: As a best practice, for workflows that 
 run to completion immediately, it is acceptable to make changes and redeploy 
 the assembly. If the workflow runs for an indefinite period of time, and 
 therefore could be persisted to secondary storage (i.e. the database for 
 <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span>), you should 
 never change the structure of the workflow and redeploy. &#160;If you 
 are sure that change will not have an impact on the persisted state of 
 a workflow, it may be acceptable to change; however, it is still considered 
 a risk. &#160;A better approach would be to version your workflows, such 
 as by naming convention.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If necessary, you can remove workflows persisted 
 to secondary storage by deleting the PROCESSINSTANCEESTATE records in 
 the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> database 
 for the associated workflow type.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive">Q: The message "Process Host Not Found" 
 appears in the Process Tasks pane in my Web Client. What could cause this 
 error?</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A: The Process Tasks pane appears in the 
 Web Client when you have enabled <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 ProcessTasksTasklet for an entity Detail view. To enable the Web Client 
 tasklet to consume the Process Host service, the service must be registered 
 with the <span class="PrimaryPortalPrimary">Saleslogix (Web Client) portal</span> 
 in its ServiceHost.xml file. &#160;Portal Deployment uses portal dependencies 
 to write &lt;service&gt; entries to this file.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the message "Process Host Not Found" 
 appears in your Process Tasks pane, then you may have deployed SlxClient 
 in such a way that the ServiceHosts.xml file does not contain any entries, 
 or the process host URL that is listed in ServiceHosts.xml is not a valid 
 Process Host URL. The file ServiceHosts.xml file in the root of the <span class="PrimaryPortalPrimary">Saleslogix (Web Client) portal</span> 
 (for example: C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\SlxClient\ServiceHosts.xml) should have 
 a &lt;service&gt; entry similar to the following:</p>
        <p class="code-snippet" style="margin-left: 64px;"><span class="code">&lt;service 
 name="ProcessHost"&gt;http://servername:port/ProcessHost&lt;/service&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="code-snippet" style="margin-left: 64px;">&#160;</p>
