 Goal-Driven Workflows</h1>
        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered">A goal-driven workflow is similar to a traditional 
 state machine workflow, except it is less restrictive in its approach 
 to moving between states. &#160;This approach can be used to provide process 
 guidance and report, without forcing users to complete a set of steps 
 in a particular order.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Goals</p>
        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered">A goal is the smallest unit of work in a 
 goal-driven workflow. Goals are also referred to as steps, activities, 
 or tasks. You can represent a goal in your workflow with a <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> workflow entity, GoalActivity. 
 Each GoalActivity has a status. To permit <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 users to change the status of goals to completed or cancelled, you can 
 add the <a href="Enabling_the_Process_Tasks_Tasklet.htm">Process Tasks 
 pane</a><a name="kanchor75"></a> to entity Detail views. Alternatively, you can create your own 
 interface using the Process Orchestration API.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Stages</p>
        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered">You can group a set of goals into a stage 
 by dropping them onto the stage in the Workflow Designer. A stage is considered 
 completed only when all the goals inside of it are either completed or 
 cancelled. Represent a stage with the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 workflow entity, GoalDrivenActivity.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Scopes</p>
        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered">Scopes provide the ability to restrict what 
 goals can be completed at any one time. &#160;Only goals and stages in 
 the active scope can be processed, and only one scope can be active at 
 a time. &#160;For example, you might create separate Sales and Fulfillment 
 scopes. &#160;Represent a scope with the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 workflow entity, GoalDrivenScopeActivity. The goals and stages you drop 
 into it can be completed in any order, but they must all be done before 
 progressing to another scope.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Lifetime of a Goal-Driven Workflow</p>
        <p class="Topic-Text-Numbered">Once a goal-driven workflow is instantiated, 
 it typically waits for messages at various steps. For example, a New Leads 
 Checklist workflow might be instantiated when a new lead is created. The 
 workflow waits for messages that the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Saleslogix</span> 
 client sends when a user checks off various steps. Goal-driven workflow 
 instances are deleted once all their stages are completed. Because goal-driven 
 workflows often wait for some communication, they exist over some meaningful 
 duration. Thus they are likely to be persisted to the database and can 
 be restarted if ProcessHost must be restarted.</p>
