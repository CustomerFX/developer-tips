 Job Notification Visibility</h1>
        <p>The Job Manager provides a user interface for creating and managing 
 the jobs sent to the Saleslogix Job Server. Job Server is an engine for 
 processing single and\or recurring tasks for immediate or delayed execution. 
 The Job Server is a shared service that can be consumed by any Saleslogix 
 client, including Web, Windows, and Mobile. There are 9 threads to the 
 Job Server, enabling multiple jobs to run at one time.</p>
        <p>Users with Administrative permissions can access the Job Manager interface, 
 however all users send jobs to be processed by the Job Server when they 
 perform any of the following pre-defined job types:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;">
            <li value="1">Run or schedule reports</li>
            <li value="2">Export files to Excel</li>
            <li value="3">Roll over incomplete activities</li>
            <li value="4">Update remaining days of contracts</li>
            <li value="5">Update opportunities</li>
            <li value="6">Update or delete leads using the task pane.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Job Notification Widget notifies users when their jobs are ready. 
 &#160;These ‘notifications’ are retrieved from SData using the contract 
 scheduling service executions endpoint.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive"><a name="kanchor64"></a><a name="kanchor65"></a>Url example for retrieving job notifications:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">http://10.40.241.30/slxclient/slxdata.ashx/$app/scheduling/-/executions</p>
        <p>The rendering of the Job Notification Widget is contained within a method 
 called BuildJobNotificationButtonTag. &#160;This method is called as part 
 of the page load for each of the base.master and dashboard.master configuration 
 files. By default, the widget is not visible, and is set to query the 
 job services executions endpoint every 5 minutes. When a result set is 
 returned for the currently logged-in user, the notifications alert button 
 becomes visible. It will remain visible for as long as the current user 
 has existing executions. An execution is kept for approximately 1 hour.</p>
        <p class="Infinitive">Configuring the Job Notification Widget</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;">
            <li value="1">If you choose to, you can modify the amount of time a job notification 
	 remains in the Job Notification Widget. &#160;The notifications poll 
	 interval is configurable in the SlxClient web portal appSettings.config 
	 file, the key is entitled JobNotificationPollInterval.</li>
            <li value="2">As with activity alerts, the Job Notification widget cannot currently 
	 be disabled on an individual user basis. However it can be disabled 
	 for all users &#160;by removing the call to the BuildJobNotificationButtonTag 
	 method in the both the base.master and dashboard.master configuration 
	 files. </li>
        </ul>
